     <h1> Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Hailey Ortega</h3>
   
    <h2>Best laugh</h2>
    <p>If you were to ask me to show you the. funniest video I've seen on the web lately, I would have to go with this video below. I think we can all agrue TikTok is addicting.</p>

    <h2>Too funny</h2>
    <p>I'm sure we can all agree TikTok always displays exactly what videos relate to you. I found this video funny as for my boyfriend still is learning on how to take care of the animals.</p>

    <h2>One that never gets old</h2>
    <p>This video I remember first seeing on Facebook! This little boy was so funny and we could watch this videos a couple times before it got old. "Listen Linda" is a phrase that if you've seen this video it will always stick with you. You might even use it on people every now and then.</p>
