    <p>I'm currently work at Blackjack Pizza.  My title in is <em>Manager</em>. I currently run the day shifts, which include handling money, preparing for the night shift, and making sure customers are pleased.</p>
    <p>At home I am a responsible for a dog named Sandy and a cat named Kevin.  I have recently found a joy in working out. When Sandy can she loves to take walks at night so we can get our last steps in for the day. I am trying to teach myself everything I need to know in order to start my own soap business, this includes lately learning how to make it. When we have time, my boyfriend and I are trying to complete puzzles, glue them together, to end up with a puzzle wall in the end.</p>
